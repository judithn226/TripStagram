## Versioning strategy

React Form Input Validation follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). React Form Input Validation version numbers have three parts: major.minor.patch. The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release.

* **Major releases** contain significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs.
* **Minor releases** contain important new features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release.
* **Patch releases** are low risk, contain bug fixes and small new features. No developer assistance is expected during update.
